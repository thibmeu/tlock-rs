tlock_age is a library to encrypt and decrypt [age](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md) filekey using [tlock](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189) scheme. It provides an age Identity and Recipient consuming Threshold BLS signatures provided by [drand](https://drand.love/docs/specification/) beacons.

The reference interroperable Go implementation is available at [drand/tlock](https://github.com/drand/tlock).

## Features

* Timelock encryption and decryption in the age format
* ASCII Armor
* tlock header decryption
* Encryption with public key on G1 and G2
* Interroperability with Go and JS implementation
* wasm32 compatible library

## Installation

| Environment        | CLI Command               |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------|
| Cargo (Rust 1.67+) | `cargo install tlock_age` |

The library is tested against the following targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `wasm32-wasi`.

## Usage

Code examples are provided in [tlock_age/examples](./tlock_age/examples).

The tlock system relies on [unchained drand networks](https://drand.love/docs/cryptography/#randomness).

This crate does not provide a drand client. You can use [drand_core](https://github.com/thibmeu/drand-rs).

## Security Considerations

This software has not been audited. Please use at your sole discretion. With this in mind, dee security relies on the following:
* [tlock: Practical Timelock Encryption from Threshold BLS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189) by Nicolas Gailly, Kelsey Melissaris, and Yolan Romailler, and its implementation in [drand/tlock](https://github.com/drand/tlock),
* [Identity-Based Encryption](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/bfibe.pdf) by Dan Boneh, and Matthew Franklin, and its implementation in [thibmeu/tlock-rs](https://github.com/thibmeu/tlock-rs),
* The choosen drand beacon to remain honest,
* [age](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md) encryption protocol, and its implementation in [str4d/rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage),

## FAQ

### How does practical timelock encryption work

For the simple explanation, you can use [Handwaving Cryptography](./assets/handwaving-cryptography.md).

For a more detailed one, you should take time to read [tlock: Practical Timelock Encryption from Threshold BLS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189) by Nicolas Gailly, Kelsey Melissaris, and Yolan Romailler.

### How can I use it from the command line

You need a client. Clients using tlock-rs are
* [dee](https://github.com/thibmeu/drand-rs)
* [age-plugin-tlock](https://github.com/thibmeu/tlock-rs/age-plugin-tlock)
